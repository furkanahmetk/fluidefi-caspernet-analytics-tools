        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>FLUIDEFIÂ® is an award-winning platform that provides provides near real-time<sup><span style="color: deepskyblue;">1</span></sup>
            analytics, portfolio management, and alerting
            for thousands of decentralized financial (DeFi) digital assets. FLUIDEFI's analytics are calculated by
            patent-pending algorithms using blockchain transaction logs.</p>
        <p>The FLUIDEFI RESTful API allows developers to:
        <ul>
            <li>obtain detailed, accurate analytics of digital asset to identify investment opportunities across
                multiple decentralized exchanges;</li>
            <li>save their favorite tokens and liquidity pools for easy tracking;</li>
            <li>create portfolios the digital assets from multiple platforms;</li>
            <li>model the portfolio's performance based on historical returns;</li>
            <li>optimize the balances of the portfolios to maximize future profitability;</li>
            <li>monitor and receive alerts when digital asset metrics reach specified values or change over periods of
                time;</li>
            <li>analyze the actual profit and loss of digital asset holdings including those spread across multiple
                portfolios (wallets);</li>
            <li>swap digital assets more securely than ;</li>
            <li>add and remove liquidity from liquidity pools;</li>
            <li>develop and execute algorithmic trading strategies;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><sup><span style="color: deepskyblue;">1</span></sup>The term "near real-time" refers to the time delay
            introduced by 1) automated data processing and 2) network transmission between the occurrence of an event
            and the request of the processed data (the API call). The API responses include <i>as_of_timestamp</i> that
            specifies the UTC date/time that the API response was generated and <i>last_processed</i> which includes the
            UTC date/time the information was last calculated. FLUIDEFI uses ISO 8601 format for datetimes.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>ACCESS TO THE FLUIDEFI API</h3>
        <p>Accessing the FLUIDEFI RESTful API requires:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A username and password. This information is provided when enrolling for the FLUIDEFI services.</li>
            <li>The API endpoint to use. The API end-point will be in the form of a URL. For example:
                https://analytics.fluidefi.com<br><br>
                <div class="verticalLine" style="padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; background-color: lightgray;">
                    NOTE: The API end-point URL for your account is based on your FLUIDEFI subscription level,
                    described here:
                    <a href="/price_plans/" target="_blank" title="FLUIDEFI Subscription Price Plans">
                        https://analytics.fluidefi.com/price_plans/</a>
                </div>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>Depending on your subscription level, the IP address(es) of your computer(s) making API requests may
                need to be white-listed with the FLUIDEFI network firewall. Please send an email with your username and
                the IP address(es) to be whitelisted to FLUIDEFI Support. Static IP addresses are recommended. Note:
                when using dynamic IP addresses, the FLUIDEFI firewall does not automatically update when your dynamic
                IP address changes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        The FLUIDEFI platform has been OWASP certified. Contact us for the certificate.
        <br/>
        All API requests must be made to your designated API URL using HTTPS protocol via TCP/IP port 443 with TLS v1.3
        or later and a quantum-ready SSL Cipher Suite. All FLUIDEFI servers use SSL certificates with sha256RSA
        signature algorithms issued by <i>Sectigo RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA</i>.
        <br/>
        <div class="verticalLine" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; background-color: lightgray;">It is important to
            note that some API calls can generate very long responses. Please
            review this documentation for performance recommendations.

        <h3>CRYPTOCURRENCY & DIGITAL TOKEN PRICES</h3>
        <p>FLUIDEFI calculates prices using only decentralized exchange data extracted directly from the blockchain
            (no centralized exchange data is used). Our pricing algorthm relies on liquidity pools, such as Uniswap and
            Sushiswap, to construct a price index for a particular token or cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p>Assume we would like to find the price of wBitcoin. The following steps are taken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify all pools where wBTC is paired with BUSD, USDC, USDT, or WETH.</li>
            <li>Compute the implied price of wBTC from each pool (by assuming equal value of reserves for both tokens).
            </li>
            <li>Compute a poolsize-weighted average of the implied prices, so that larger liquidity pools have more
                influence on what the price should be.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>APR VS. APY: WHATâS THE DIFFERENCE?</h3>
        <p>Both annual percentage yield (APY) and annual percentage rate (APR) refer to the annual return generated from
            an investment, but they do so in different ways.</p>

        <p>APY takes into account the compounding effect, and reports the annual return using one piece of information:
            the annual return itself.
            However, APR's calculation does not factor in compounding, and therefore reports the annual return using two
            pieces of information: the APR + the compounding frequency.</p>

        <p>Here's an example of how both metrics are computed.
            Assume that for the past month, the total return for an investment is 2%. We calculate APR and APY as
            follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>APR = 2% * 12 = 24%</li>
            <li>APY = (1+2%)12 -1 = 26.82%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this case, APY > APR due to the compounding effect that is not taken into account by APR.</p>
        <p>Also, note that these two statements are equivalent and both report how much return to expect in a year:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Annual return of this investment is 26.82%</li>
            <li>This investment has an APR of 24%, compounded monthly</li>
        </ol>
        <p>APY is the simpler way of reporting the same information. For this reason, FLUIDEFI emphasizes APY
            figures.</p>

        <h3>SUPPORTED BASE CURRENCIES FOR CALCULATIONS</h3>
        <p>FLUIDEFI currently supports 24 fiat currencies, gold, silver, and 8,000+ digital assets & cryptocurrencies.
            Examples: USD, WETH, GBP, CAD, CHF, JPY, AUD, NZD, HKD, EUR, NOK, SEK, SGD, CNY, KRW, AED, BRL, XAU8, & XAG.
            If you need a fiat currency that is not listed here, contact support using the method below.</p>

        <h3>PRECISION</h3>
        <p>FLUIDEFI supports a precision of 160, which is the size of sqrtX96 variable in many smart-contracts used vr
            DeFi platforms. The precision of a number is the total count of significant digits in the whole number, or,
            in other words, the number of digits to both sides of the decimal point. For example: the number 123.4567
            has a precision of 7. It is not uncommon to have amounts displayed as 8 digits to the left of the decimal
            and 16 digits to the right.</p>

        <h3>DATETIME FORMAT</h3>
        <p>FLUIDEFI supports ISO 8601 standard format date and datetimes. All datetimes are in UTC. The GET methods
            support YYYY-MM-DD. Example: "2021-06-01". POST methods support datetimes. Example:
            "2021-10-18T19:19:06.982417".</p>

        <h3>RATE LIMITING</h3>
        <p>Rate limits are based on your subscription level and vary between 5 and 60 calls per second.</p>

        <h3>"CURRENTLY IN ALPHA" AND "CURRENTLY IN BETA"</h3>
